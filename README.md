Astromatch is a front-end development project of an imaginary web-desktop-first responsive application, as an activity result of Labenu's full-stack development course. This code was mostly estructured and executed by Labenu's teachers Soter Padua and Pedro Darvas. I was responsible for developing React-Redux routes and some specific layout features on the SwipeScreen, MatchScreen and ProfileScreen components.
